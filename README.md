# Codsoft-AI Internship

This repository contains three projects developed during the Codsoft-AI Internship.

### 1. Chat Bot with Rule-Based Response

The chat bot project implements a rule-based approach to generate responses based on predefined rules. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to understand user queries and provide appropriate answers.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe with AI (Alpha-Beta Pruning & Mini-Max Algorithm)

The Tic Tac Toe project implements an AI player using the Alpha-Beta Pruning and Mini-Max algorithm. It provides a challenging opponent for playing the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

### 3. Image Captioning using VGG and RNN

The image captioning project combines the power of the VGG model for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for generating captions. It can generate descriptive captions for images.

## Getting Started
